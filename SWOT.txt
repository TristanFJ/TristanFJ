I'm an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/5cab205c96cff). Below I discuss some of my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. 

### Strengths
- I enjoy reading, so that's something I've spent a lot of time doing, and I think that has improved my critical reading and communication skills. 

- I believe my interest in Philosophy is a unique resource that has strengthened my understanding of logic and general reasoning. This interest has also influenced my perspective on ethics and how important it is that we reflect on our goals and actions. 

- I've been told I have a very logical mindset and that this allows me to analyze a problem or situation thoroughly. 

### Weaknesses 
- I have a tendency to over-complicate things. I'm working on improving this by breaking problems down into smaller chunks and approaching each step in itself. 

- I think part of this over-complication can result in decision paralysis, but I'm working on improving that with practice and tools like mindfulness. 

- Others would probably see my logically-oriented mindset as a weakness in some situations. 

### Opportunities 
- I have a wide range of interests when it comes to software and technology in general and I believe this creates an opportunity to bridge gaps where untapped synergies may be found. 

- I'm also a strong believer that user data and privacy should be respected, and I believe the platforms that will do the best are those that respect the user's rights. 

- Technology is constantly changing and I believe I have the mindset that can adapt with the times to leverage these changes. 

### Threats 
- I'm not just interested in money and I want to be personally involved with a company's mission, so this may reduce my potential options. 

- Not every company respects user rights, as it's not always profitable to do so, and so that is in a sense who I would be competing with. 

- Not every problem is logical or as complex as it seems, and so that approach may be a threat if I try and apply it universally.

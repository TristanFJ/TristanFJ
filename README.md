### Hi there 👋

I'm Tristan. I'm interested in many things in life, but my main focuses are information technology and philosophy. I'm presently studying web development because I believe the internet is one of the largest forces for good among Humanity's accomplishments. 



### Thank you

I appreciate your time, if you would like to get in touch please email me here: tfj@pm.me

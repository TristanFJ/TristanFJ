### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tristan. I'm interested in many things in life, but my main focuses are information technology and philosophy. I'm presently practicing software engineering because I believe software is one of the largest forces for good among Humanity's accomplishments. 

Presently I'm learning iOS development with Swift, but most of this code is proprietary. 

### Thank you
